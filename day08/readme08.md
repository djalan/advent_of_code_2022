# why not 2d list
- can't make slices vertically

# why not matrix
- matrix is a subclass of ndarray
- don't need matrix for [m,n] access of elements

# why not np.ndarray
- np.array is the preferred method to create an ndarray
- np.empty
- np.zeros

# logging warning
- do not use fstring, use %s formatting to use optimization in logging library
