## Day 08
### Part 1
#### why not 2d list
- can't make slices vertically
#### why not matrix
- matrix is a subclass of ndarray
- don't need matrix for [m,n] access of elements
#### why not np.ndarray
- np.array is the preferred method to create an ndarray
- np.empty
- np.zeros
#### logging warning
- do not use fstring, use %s formatting to use optimization in logging library



## Day09

```python
visited = [tuple([0,0])]
```
